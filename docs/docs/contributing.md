Thanks for showing interest to contribute to `graz` <3

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to graz, which are hosted in the [Strangelove Ventures Organization](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [`graz` Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Brief of graz

### What is graz?

`graz` is a collection of React hooks containing everything you need to start working with the Cosmos ecosystem.

### Why this library exist?

Currently there is no stable library for cosmos wallets. We were inspired by the patterns in [`wagmi`](https://wagmi.sh) in the Etherium ecosystem.

## What should I know before I get started?

It greatly helps if you already have a basic understanding of:

- [Cosmos ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/)
- [`react-query`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
- [`zustand`](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
- [Keplr Wallet](https://docs.keplr.app)

## Setup the Project

The following steps will get you up and running to contribute to `graz`:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of [this page](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/graz))

2. Clone your fork locally

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/graz.git
